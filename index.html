<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  This is a complete overview of all of my Visual Summaries made for the minor VisInt, of each week, published on this website. <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ellisgroenveld/VisInt-WeeklySummary">The source code on GitHub can be found here</a> <br>
  This is fully based on the Portfolio document and archives found in a private OneDrive. <br>
  And this website also includes links to visuals made as websites as can be found in <a href="#week3">Week 3</a> for example.
</p>

<h1 id="week1">Week 1: How I travelled a day</h1>
<!-- Your Week 1 content here -->
<p>
  To make a visual of the first classday of my first week, <br>
  I made a concept of a day travelling through Maastricht, going to Zuyd, going to work, taking a walk. <br>
  The story behind this is that I wanted to show others what my average day looks like. <br> <br>

<h1 id="week2">Week 2: How I would have travelled a day if it was Ancient Rome</h1>
<!-- Your Week 2 content here -->
<p>
  To visualise a similar day as in Week 1, the idea came to make a touchable physical version of it to further use the senses. <br>
  There was also the idea to put myself in a different location which ended up being Rome at 250AD just cause it interested me. <br>
  The idea is that my day travelling through Rome has been visualised as if it was me right now travelling there. <br> <br>

<h1 id="week3">Week 3: Coffee Visual - my coffee habbits</h1>
<!-- Your Week 3 content here -->
<p>
  The Visual Summary for this week I made a visualisation of all of the coffee I drank with their exact locations and made it into a simple interactive visual. <br>
  This one can be found here: <a href="week3">Coffee Visual</a> <br>
  The story behind this visual is that I wanted to show people how much coffee I drink, which I enjoy the most and see if there is a correlation as to where. <br> 
  Underneath this paragraph you can also find a screenshot of the visual and the table of used data inside the visual. <br> <br>
